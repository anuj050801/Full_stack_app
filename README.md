# Full_stack_app
CRUD App with Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This repository contains the code for a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the Express framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application utilizes MySQL for querying data and demonstrates how to connect it to an Express app, allowing you to build a full-stack application.

In the accompanying video tutorial, we will go through the step-by-step process of creating this CRUD app. We'll cover the following topics:

Setting up the development environment
Creating the Express application
Designing the HTML templates
Styling the application using CSS
Implementing CRUD functionality with Express and MySQL
Connecting the MySQL database to the Express app
Running and testing the application
